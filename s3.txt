S3(Simple Storage Service)
=====================
Q: What is Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It’s a simple storage service that offers software developers a highly-scalable, reliable, and low-latency data storage infrastructure at very low costs.

In March 2006 amazon launched S3

storage types:
===========

1) block storage : one instance can mount at a time.( storage may be with in the system or it may be a LUN)

2) File storage : storage can be connected to more than one instance. eg: NFS. dynamic format i.e changes will reflect in all systems at a time.

3) Object storage : No instance required for this kind of storage.(url based). we cant modify existing, if we want to modify


What is Bucket?

It is nothing but collection of objects.

* Buckets are globally unique containers for everything that you store in Amazon S3.
* After you create a bucket, you can upload your objects (for example, your photo or video files)
* By default, the permissions on an object are private, but you can set up access control    policies to grant permissions to others

* we can create 100 buckets per an account.
* but for objects in the bucket is no limit.
* max we can upload 5TB

What are objects?

nothing but like files.

What is folder?

Folder is nohing but it will hold the objects without metadata.

Q: How much data can I store?

The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited. Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes. The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. For objects larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart Upload capability.


Storage Classes
============

1) Standard

* Durability is 99.999999999
* Availiability is 99.99
* Cost is also high.
* failures also very less(4 failures per 1000)
*Concurant FT -2 instances
* In general if data is used very frequently we will use this storage.

2) Infrequant Access(IA)
* Durability is 99.999999999
* Availiability is 99.9
*Concurant FT -2 instances
* In general if data is not used frequently we will use this storage.

3) Reduce Redundancy Storage (RRS)

* Durability is 99.99
* Availiability is 99.99
* Concurant FT -1 instances
* if storage is reprodusable or easily accessable. we will use this kind of storage.



S3 Encryption:
===========

* Server side encryption.
* Client side encryption.

If we will enable the versioning once, we can't disable. but we can suspend.


How to host a static website on s3:
==========================

1) create bucket
2) go to bucket properties
3) enable static webhosting
